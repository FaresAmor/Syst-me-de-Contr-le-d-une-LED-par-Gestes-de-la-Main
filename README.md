This project demonstrates a Python-based system for controlling an LED using hand gestures. The application captures inputs from a sensor or camera and interprets hand movements to perform actions such as turning the LED on or off. It includes the following key components:

- controller.py: This script handles the core functionality for recognizing hand gestures and sending control signals to the LED.
- new.py: A supplementary script for additional or alternative functionalities in gesture recognition or LED control.
- connection.png: A visual representation of how the hardware components (like the LED) are connected to the control system.

The project can be used as a foundation for more advanced gesture-controlled systems or as a learning tool for embedded systems and Python-based automation.
